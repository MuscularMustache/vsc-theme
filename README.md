# vsc-theme
Visual Studio Code Theme

This theme uses the general color scheme of the Galea theme (https://github.com/allanhortle/Centurion) because i love it.

# Installation
*Note: I'm using a Mac, cause I'm a mac daddy!*

* Find the root of your application and right click (I use brew cask to install everything so mine lives in ```/opt/hombrew-cask/Caskroom/visual-studio-code``` but chances are it it will be somewhere in you appications 
* Right click on visual studio code and click on package contents
* From there follow this path: ```Contents/Resources/app/client/vs/monaco/ui/workbench/native```
* Drop this css file in there and restart visual studio code
* BAM - all done

*Note 2.0: I will be updating some stuff, like fonts and highlight color preferences as time goes on*

*Also if you want to edit this, or the base monaco theme you can open this file is vsc and click help, then toggle developer tools*
